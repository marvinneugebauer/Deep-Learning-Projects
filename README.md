# Deep-Learning-Projects
Overview of some of my deep learning projects in recent time.


# Description of the Projects

- **Project: Adding Machine**
    +  In this project, we build a feedforward neural network (FFN) capable of adding two integers between -10 and 10. To ensure the consistency of our results, we conduct an experiment by constructing the same model architecture ten times and evaluating the obtained results.. The file that contains the code is ``adding_machine.ipynb``.
- **Project: Wine Dataset**
    +  In part 1 of this project, we leverage the wine-quality dataset to construct a simple deep learning model aimed at classifying wine quality through physicochemical tests. Furthermore, we conduct a parametric experiment, testing various batch sizes and comparing their accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the outcomes derived from the experiment. The file that contains the code is ``experiment_minibatch_size.ipynb``.
